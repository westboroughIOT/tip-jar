## How To
### Use Device
Owners of a Tip Jar will typically place the device in front of their customer during some type of service.  When a customer feels that the owner has done a good service they will reward the owner with an certain amount of coinage.  This coinage is placed in the Tip Jar device by the customer.  The device then keeps track of the reward and details can be accessed via a web interface.

### Build
There are currently different versions of "Tip Jar".  Each version is determined on what type of sensors were selected.  However, the objective and results should be fairly the same.  Go to the [built-with](built-with/) directory and find the specific instructions on how to build there.
